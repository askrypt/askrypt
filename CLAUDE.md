# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Askrypt is a cross-platform password manager. It authenticates users via security question answers (normalized and hashed with PBKDF2) rather than a master password, using AES-256-CBC encryption for vault data. The repository is a Cargo workspace holding a **desktop Rust app** plus a **pure-Dart Flutter mobile app** (`app/`) that re-implements the same vault format — see [Mobile app](#mobile-app-app) below.

**Warning**: The project is under active development and has not undergone extensive security testing.

> **Rule — keep this file current.** At the end of any change that alters the
> repository layout, architecture, build/test commands, dependencies, or the
> vault format, update `CLAUDE.md` (and, for mobile work, `app/PLAN.md`) in the
> same change so the docs never drift from the code.

> **Rule — print a short commit when changes are done.** After completing a
> code change, print a short, conventional commit message (a single
> `type: subject` line, ≤ 72 chars) for the change so it's ready to copy. This
> only prints the message — do not run `git commit` unless asked.

## Architecture

The crypto/format engine lives in the **`core/`** crate (`askrypt-core`, lib name `askrypt`) and is the source of truth for the vault format. The desktop Iced app in **`src/`** depends on it, and the Dart mobile core in **`app/lib/crypto/`** re-implements it (kept in lock-step by golden test vectors). Phase 0 extracted the engine into `core/`; older docs may still say it lives in `src/`.

### Core crate — `core/src/` (the security model)

- **`core/src/types.rs`** — Core data types: `SecretEntry`, `Params`, `QuestionsData`, `MasterData`, `AskryptFile`. Re-exported from `lib.rs`.
- **`core/src/lib.rs`** — Crypto core: encryption (AES-256-CBC), key derivation (PBKDF2/SHA-256), ZIP archive handling, serialization, and `to_bytes`/`from_bytes` (in-memory ZIP). Contains 25+ unit tests. This is the heart of the security model.
- **`core/src/passgen.rs`** — Password generator with configurable character sets and length.
- **`core/src/translit.rs`** — Russian/Ukrainian-to-English transliteration using BGN/PCGN romanization, QWERTY-only output. ё→yo, е→e, ъ/ь dropped, тс and ц both→ts. Ukrainian: ґ→g, є→ye, і→i, ї→yi.
- **`core/examples/gen_vectors.rs`** — Emits golden test vectors to `app/test/fixtures/vectors.json` for the Dart parity tests. Regenerate whenever the format or normalization changes.

### Desktop app — `src/` (Iced GUI)

- **`src/main.rs`** — Desktop GUI using the [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) framework. Follows Iced's Elm-like architecture: `Message` enum for events, `update()` for state transitions, `view()` for rendering. Also handles auto-lock and Smart Lock logic. The Edit Questions screen includes a "Use transliteration" checkbox that enables Russian/Ukrainian transliteration for answer normalization.
- **`src/ui.rs`** — Reusable styled UI components and theming helpers.
- **`src/icon.rs`** — Bootstrap icon glyph constants for use in the UI.
- **`src/tray.rs`** — System-tray integration.
- **`src/settings.rs`** — Persistent user settings stored as JSON in platform config directories: `%APPDATA%\askrypt\` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/askrypt/` (macOS), `~/.config/askrypt/` (Linux).

### Security / Encryption Model

1. User provides answers to security questions.
2. Answers are normalized (lowercased, whitespace/dashes stripped, optionally transliterated from Russian/Ukrainian via `Params.translit`).
3. Each answer is used with PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations by default) to derive a key.
4. A layered encryption scheme: first answer unlocks subsequent questions, all answers together unlock the master key, the master key encrypts the actual secrets.
5. Vault files are ZIP archives containing JSON metadata and encrypted blobs. See `SPEC.md` for the full format specification.

Secret material is wiped from memory with [`zeroize`](https://docs.rs/zeroize): the secret-bearing structs (`SecretEntry`, `MasterData`, `QuestionsData`) derive `ZeroizeOnDrop`, and transient scratch (derived keys, normalized/combined answers, hashed answers, decrypted plaintext buffers) is wrapped in `Zeroizing` in `core/src/lib.rs` and the desktop Smart Lock paths. Note: `core` derives keys via the `derive_key` helper rather than `calc_pbkdf2(..)?.try_into()`, which would free the PBKDF2 `Vec` without wiping it; in the desktop app the lock/Smart-Lock handlers `.zeroize()` secrets instead of `.clear()` (which only truncates). The `aes`/`cbc` cipher's internal key copy is not reachable and stays unwiped. The Dart mobile app has no equivalent (GC'd, immutable strings).

### Mobile app — `app/`

A **pure-Dart Flutter** app for Android + iOS (no Rust on device, no FFI/bridge). It re-implements the vault format in Dart and must stay byte-compatible with `core/`; parity is guaranteed by golden test vectors, not shared code. Full plan and phase status live in **`app/PLAN.md`**.

- **`app/lib/crypto/`** — Dart port of the crypto core (`vault`, `kdf`, `aes`, `normalize`, `translit`, `secret_entry`), mirroring `core/src/*.rs`.
- **`app/lib/session/`** — Riverpod session layer: `UnlockedVault` (in-memory state, secret-free `EntrySummary`, reveal-on-demand CRUD, `toBytes()`) and a sealed `VaultSession` (`VaultLocked`/`VaultUnlocked`) behind `vaultSessionProvider`. The 600k-iteration PBKDF2 work is CPU-bound, so `pbkdf2` (`crypto/kdf.dart`) delegates to native, hardware-accelerated platform crypto via `cryptography_flutter` (Android `javax.crypto` / iOS CommonCrypto), falling back to the `cryptography` Dart impl off-device (tests) — byte-identical output, verified by the golden vectors. Native runs without blocking the Dart event loop, so the crypto entry points are plain `async` and `await`ed on the main isolate (no `Isolate.run`): `AskryptFile.getQuestionsData`/`create`, `UnlockedVault.open`/`toBytes`. The unlock screen shows a progress indicator while a derivation runs.
- **`app/lib/screens/`** — Feature-parity screens (welcome, layered unlock, entries list + search/tags/hidden, entry editor, questions editor, password generator) plus `auto_lock.dart` (lock on background / inactivity).
- **`app/lib/passgen.dart`** — Dart port of `core/src/passgen.rs`.
- **`app/lib/platform/`** — Platform seams, faked in tests: `vault_io.dart` (over `file_picker`); `recent_vault_store.dart` (caches the **encrypted** bytes + name of the last successfully unlocked vault in the app-support dir via `path_provider` — SAF URIs have no persistable path — refreshed on unlock/save, behind the welcome screen's "Open \<name\>" reopen button); and the Phase 4 mobile-security seams `biometric_store.dart` (answers-only biometric quick-unlock via `local_auth` + `flutter_secure_storage`, keyed by `sha256(question0)`; the unlock screen additionally asks one randomly chosen security answer as a knowledge check before opening), `secure_clipboard.dart` (sensitive copy + 30 s auto-clear), and `platform_security.dart` (the `MethodChannel('askrypt/secure')` for `FLAG_SECURE` + sensitive-clipboard, implemented in `MainActivity.kt`/`AppDelegate.swift`).
- **`app/test/`** — Crypto parity tests against `app/test/fixtures/vectors.json`, session tests, passgen tests, and widget tests.

App ID `com.askrypt.app`, display name "Askrypt", `minSdk 26`. The `android/` and `ios/` shells are tracked in git.

**Android toolchain is pinned** (`app/android/settings.gradle.kts` + `gradle-wrapper.properties`) to **AGP 8.11.1 / Gradle 8.14 / Kotlin 2.2.20**, not the `flutter create` default of AGP 9.x: file_picker 11.x doesn't apply the Kotlin Gradle plugin on AGP ≥ 9, so its plugin class fails to compile. Floor is AGP ≥ 8.9.1 + compileSdk 36 (`androidx.core 1.17.0`, pulled by Flutter 3.44.1). `flutter build apk --debug` is green against the SDK at `~/Android/Sdk`. Don't bump AGP to 9 until file_picker supports it.

`MainActivity` extends **`FlutterFragmentActivity`** (not the default `FlutterActivity`) because `local_auth`'s biometric prompt requires a `FragmentActivity` host; it also registers the `askrypt/secure` channel. iOS needs `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`.
